# Plan

## Purpose

This project is a practice and calibration environment.

The goal is to simulate, end-to-end, the exact type of work that will eventually be delivered to Personal Injury (PI) law firms, without the pressure of a real client.

This repo exists to:

practice building high-quality landing pages

practice branding customization (fonts, colors, logos, layout)

practice basic form creation and UX flows

practice pushing, updating, and managing a project via GitHub

build confidence and muscle memory for repeatable client delivery

This is not a production site.
This is a rehearsal stage.

## Primary Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I should be able to confidently:

Create a modern, premium landing page from scratch

Modify layout, typography, colors, and spacing intentionally

Add custom branding assets (logos, icons, images)

Implement a simple form (contact / eligibility / CTA-style)

Understand how local files map to a live deployed site

Push changes to GitHub and pull them back reliably

Repeat this workflow for future client projects without friction

If these are achieved, the project is a success.

## Conceptual Target

This project represents a “parallel intake / decision-support landing page” concept.

The page should feel:

calm, not urgent

clear, not legalistic

modern, not gimmicky

confident, not salesy

It should resemble something that could be adapted for a PI law firm, but will remain generic for now.

## Scope (Intentional Constraints)

To avoid overbuilding, this project is intentionally limited:

Single-page landing page

No backend logic

No database

Simple or mock form handling is acceptable

Desktop-first, but responsive basics included

Focus on visual quality and clarity over features

If something does not directly support learning or delivery confidence, it is out of scope.

## Planned Areas of Practice
1. Layout & Structure

Hero section

Supporting content sections (services, explanation, reassurance)

Clear primary CTA

Logical visual hierarchy

2. Branding & Design

Custom color palette

Font changes (e.g. modern sans-serif, possible accent font)

Light or dark mode experimentation

Spacing, alignment, and polish

Subtle visual effects (hover, transitions)

3. Media Assets

Add a custom logo (real or placeholder)

Practice importing images or SVGs

Understand how assets are organized in the project

4. Forms

Simple form (contact, eligibility check, or similar)

Practice layout and UX around forms

No real submission logic required (can be placeholder)

5. Git & GitHub Workflow

Initialize Git in this folder

Create a GitHub repository

Push the project to GitHub

Make iterative changes and push updates

Understand the relationship between local files and the repo

## Definition of “Done” (For This Project)

This project is considered complete when:

The landing page loads cleanly in the browser

Branding and fonts are clearly customized (not default)

At least one form exists and is styled intentionally

The project is pushed to GitHub successfully

I feel confident I could repeat this process for a client

No perfection required.
Completion > polish.

## Notes to Self

This is practice, not proof of mastery

It’s okay to look things up

It’s okay to redo sections

The goal is comfort and fluency, not speed

Every small win compounds into client confidence
